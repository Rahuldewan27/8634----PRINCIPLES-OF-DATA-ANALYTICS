## Penguins Palmer Data Set

![Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png)


This folder contains the work for my module at ATU. The module is called principles of data analysis.

This folder contains 3 files. 
1. README - This is the file you are currently reading that contains instructions and references for the work submitted.
2. gitignore - File specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
3. penguins - this is the jupyter notebook that contains in depth information about the task and project. This includes data overview, histograms and bar charts as well corelation between 2 variables.

## Instructions

1. Please remember to run all kernels when you are using this notebook.
2. Notebook is broken into 5 distinct parts that help the user understand the jounrey from import of modules to corelation of data
